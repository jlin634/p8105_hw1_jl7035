### Problem 1

# load penguins data set

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

# Exploring the Penguins Data Set

``` r
head(penguins)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 8
    ##   species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g
    ##   <fct>   <fct>              <dbl>         <dbl>             <int>       <int>
    ## 1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7               181        3750
    ## 2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4               186        3800
    ## 3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18                 195        3250

    ## 6 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6               190        3650
    ## # ℹ 2 more variables: sex <fct>, year <int>

``` r
ncols_penguins <- ncol(penguins)
nrows_penguins <- nrow(penguins)

colnames_penguins <- colnames(penguins)
types_of_species <- unique(penguins %>%
                  select("species"))
which_islands <- unique(penguins %>%
                        select("island"))

mean_flipper_length <- penguins %>% 
                        summarise(mean_flipper_length = 
                                    mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
```

This dataset explores various characteristics regarding 3 different
species of penguin. The 3 species are as follows: Adelie, Gentoo,
Chinstrap. These penguins come from 3 different islands: Torgersen,
Biscoe, Dream. In total, there are 344 rows in the dataset,
corresponding to 344 sampled penguins. There are also 8 columns in this
dataset, reflecting various measures regarding the penguins
characteristics. They are as follows: (1) “species”, (2) “island”, (3)
“bill_length_mm”, (4) “bill_depth_mm”, (5) “flipper_length_mm”, (6)
“body_mass_g, (7)”sex”,(8) “year. The mean length of the flipper for
penguins in this dataset is ‘r mean(flipper_length_m)’.

# Makes Scatterplot of flipper length by bill length

``` r
flipper_by_bill_len <- ggplot(penguins, 
                        aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, 
                        color = species)) + 
                        geom_point()

ggsave("flipper_by_bill_len_plot.pdf")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

### Problem 2

# Create Table

``` r
df <- tibble(
  random_sample = rnorm(10),
  greater_than_0 = (random_sample > 0),
  char_vec = c('a', 'b','c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'),
  factor_vec = factor(c("small", "small", "small", "large", "large", "large",
                        "medium","medium", "medium", "medium"))
)
```

# Attempt to calculate means

``` r
mean(pull(df, random_sample))
```

    ## [1] 0.1612409

``` r
mean(pull(df, greater_than_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(df,char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df, factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Attempting to take the mean of each of the variables within df, we find
that the mean cannot be calculated for the vector of characters or
vector of factors. This is because they are not of numeric or logical
type.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df, greater_than_0))
as.numeric(pull(df,char_vec))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df, factor_vec))
```

Using the as.numeric function, we see that the boolean vector is
converted into binary encodings that correspond to true or false, while
the factor vector takes the 3 levels and assigns them to corresponding
integers. In both cases, integers are being used as categories to map
the original contents of the vectors to respectively. Additionaly, we
see that we are unable to convert the char vector into a numeric type,
explaining why the mean could not be taken for this variable, as there
was no corresponding numeric equivalent. This logic also shows why the
boolean vec could have its mean taken. Interestingly, the factor
variable can be converted to numeric, yet we were unable to get its
mean. Its likely that the boolean variable differs from the behavior of
the factor vec, as the “TRUE” and “FALSE” values initially assigned to
it are likely 0 and 1 under the hood.
